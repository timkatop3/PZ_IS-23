On a clear afternoon, at the end of summer,
An old man was walking along the road in the field;
I dug up a young cherry tree somewhere
And, satisfied, he carried her home.
He looked with cheerful eyes
To the fields, to the distant boundary
And I thought: “Let me remember
I'll plant a cherry tree by the road.
Let it grow big, big,
Let it go both in breadth and height
And, decorating our road,
Every year it bathes in bloom.
Travelers will lie down in her shadow,
Relax in the coolness, in silence,
And, having tasted juicy, ripe berries,
Maybe they will remember me.
But they won’t remember - what a shame -
I don't worry about this at all:
If they don’t want to, don’t remember, don’t need it,
I’ll plant cherry trees anyway!”
