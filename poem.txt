On a lear afternoon, at the end of summer,
An old man was walking along the road in the field;
I dug up a young herry tree somewhere
And, satisfied, he arried her home.
He looked with heerful eyes
To the fields, to the distant boundary
And I thought: “Let me remember
I'll plant a herry tree by the road.
Let it grow big, big,
Let it go both in breadth and height
And, deorating our road,
Every year it bathes in bloom.
Travelers will lie down in her shadow,
Relax in the oolness, in silene,
And, having tasted juiy, ripe berries,
Maybe they will remember me.
But they won’t remember - what a shame -
I don't worry about this at all:
If they don’t want to, don’t remember, don’t need it,
I’ll plant herry trees anyway!”
